//! SIMD backend abstraction for the Smith-Waterman kernel.
//!
//! Each backend exposes its native vector width via [`Backend::LANES`] and
//! three associated vector types: [`BytesVec`] for haystack bytes (LANES bytes
//! wide), [`MaskVec`] for boolean comparison results, and [`ScoreVec`] for the
//! score matrix (LANES × u16 or LANES × u8). Keeping masks as a distinct type
//! lets AVX-512 carry them as native `__mmask*` bitmasks rather than
//! 64-byte vectors, while other backends can alias [`MaskVec`] to their
//! [`BytesVec`] type with no loss.
//!
//! The kernel itself is generic over [`Backend`] and the lane count threads
//! through chunk arithmetic, the matrix stride, the alignment-path iterator,
//! and the horizontal-gap propagation unroll.
//!
//! Available backends:
//!   - AVX-512: LANES = 32/64 (scoring u16 x 32 = 512-bit or u8 x 64 = 512-bit)
//!   - AVX2:    LANES = 16/32 (scoring u16 x 16 = 256-bit or u8 x 32 = 256-bit)
//!   - SSE:     LANES = 8/16  (scoring u16 x 8 = 128-bit or u8 x 16 = 128-bit)
//!   - NEON:    LANES = 8/16  (scoring u16 x 8 = 128-bit or u8 x 16 = 128-bit)
//!   - Scalar:  LANES = 8/16 (fallback for non-SIMD systems)
